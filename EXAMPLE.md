# 👋 Hello, I'm Kamil Turek

blablabla

## 💡 My Learning Approach
My philosophy towards learning and mastering new technology is simple:
1. **Master the Basics** – I always start by getting a firm grip on the fundamentals, ensuring I can navigate the core concepts with confidence.
2. **Explore Use Cases** – After mastering the basics, I explore real-world applications, focusing on how each tool or framework can solve real problems.
3. **Compare Alternatives** – Finally, I make it a point to evaluate various tools to ensure I’m using the best fit for each problem. For example:
   - **Web Development**: Django vs. FastAPI
   - **Messaging & Event Streaming**: Kafka vs. Pub/Sub
   - **Infrastructure as Code**: Ansible vs. Terraform
   - **Data Analytics**: SAS vs. Databricks

When a tool captures my interest or shows significant promise in addressing a need, I dive deeper into the **theory behind it** and apply it in real-world **projects** to better understand its strengths and limitations.

## 🛠️ My Expertise
Throughout my career, I’ve developed a diverse set of skills and proficiencies:
Of course, I'm not highly experienced in these technologies. Additionally, I will highlight the technologies I have learned on the job (SAS and Docker) in gray, the ones I learned during my studies, mentoring, or self-study (Python, Spark) in dark green, and the technologies I have only touched upon briefly (for example, through a short course on Udemy or used sparingly in projects) in red.

- **Programming & Data Analysis**:  
    - <span style="color: gray">SAS 9.4, PROC SQL</span>  
    - <span style="color: darkgreen">Python (OOP, Numpy, Pandas, API)</span>  
- **Database Management & SQL**:  
    - <span style="color: darkgreen">Oracle, PL/SQL</span>  
    - <span style="color: red">Databricks, Snowflake</span>  
- **Big Data & ETL Technologies**:  
    - <span style="color: darkgreen">Spark, Kafka, BigQuery, ETL pipelines</span>  
- **Cloud & DevOps**:  
    - <span style="color: red">Docker, Kubernetes</span>  
    - <span style="color: red">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</span>
